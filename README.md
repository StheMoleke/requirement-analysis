# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is part of my ALX Software Engineering learning journey.

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to explore and document the process of **requirement analysis** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It includes key concepts, tools, techniques, and examples used to gather, document, and validate software requirements.

Through this project, I aim to understand how to define clear, actionable, and user-centered requirements that guide the development process and reduce the risk of scope creep.

Stay tuned as I break down different phases, diagrams, and practical use cases!

#  What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and clearly defined. It sets the foundation for building software that truly solves user problems.

This phase involves understanding what the users need the system to do, why those features are important, and identifying any technical or business limitations.
💡 Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

    ✅ Defines project scope: Helps avoid misunderstandings, scope creep, and ensures everyone is aligned.

    ✅ Saves time and cost: Catching unclear or conflicting requirements early prevents costly changes later in development.

    ✅ Improves quality: A well-defined set of requirements leads to software that is more reliable, maintainable, and user-friendly.

    ✅ Guides design and development: It serves as a blueprint for designers, developers, and testers to follow.

In essence, Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between what the client wants and what the development team builds, making it one of the most important activities in delivering successful software solutions.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is essential to the success of any software project. It ensures that the development process starts with a clear understanding of what needs to be built and why. Below are three key reasons why it is critical in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
1. 🎯 Ensures Clarity and Alignment

Requirement Analysis helps align the expectations of stakeholders, developers, and end-users. It translates vague business needs into clear, actionable requirements that everyone understands, reducing the risk of misunderstandings.
2. 💰 Saves Time and Resources

By identifying and addressing issues early, requirement analysis helps prevent expensive rework later in the project. It allows for more accurate planning, budgeting, and scheduling, which improves project efficiency.
3. ✅ Enhances Software Quality

Well-defined requirements lead to better design, more focused development, and more effective testing. This results in software that meets user needs, performs reliably, and is easier to maintain and enhance in the future.

#  Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The Requirement Analysis phase involves several structured activities that ensure a clear and shared understanding of the software to be built. Below are the five key activities involved:

    📥 Requirement Gathering

        Collecting initial requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observations, or existing documentation.

        The goal is to understand the business needs, pain points, and expectations.

    🧠 Requirement Elicitation

        Engaging with stakeholders to dig deeper into their needs using techniques like brainstorming, workshops, role-playing, and prototyping.

        Helps refine and uncover hidden or conflicting requirements.

    📝 Requirement Documentation

        Converting the gathered and elicited information into structured documents such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), use cases, and user stories.

        Ensures clarity and acts as a reference for designers, developers, and testers.

    📊 Requirement Analysis and Modeling

        Organizing and analyzing requirements to identify gaps, overlaps, or contradictions.

        Includes the creation of models like data flow diagrams, use case diagrams, and entity-relationship models to visualize the system.

    ✔️ Requirement Validation

        Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy, completeness, and feasibility.

        Ensures that the documented requirements truly represent what the stakeholders need.

        #📂 Types of Requirements

Software requirements are generally classified into two main categories: Functional Requirements and Non-functional Requirements. Both play a crucial role in defining what the system should do and how it should perform.
✅ Functional Requirements

Definition:
Functional requirements describe what the system should do — the specific features, behavior, and functions it must perform.

Examples for a Booking Management System:

    Users can search for available properties by location, date, and price.

    Users can create an account and log in securely.

    Property owners can list their properties with details and availability.

    The system must allow booking confirmations and cancellations.

    Users receive email notifications upon booking or cancellation.

⚙️ Non-functional Requirements

Definition:
Non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform — they define quality attributes like performance, usability, and security.

Examples for a Booking Management System:

    The website should load within 2 seconds on standard broadband.

    The system must support up to 10,000 concurrent users.

    Data should be encrypted both at rest and in transit.

    The platform must be mobile-responsive across devices.

    The system should have 99.9% uptime availability.
