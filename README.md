# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is part of my ALX Software Engineering learning journey.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to explore and document the process of **requirement analysis** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It includes key concepts, tools, techniques, and examples used to gather, document, and validate software requirements.

Through this project, I aim to understand how to define clear, actionable, and user-centered requirements that guide the development process and reduce the risk of scope creep.

Stay tuned as I break down different phases, diagrams, and practical use cases!

#  What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and clearly defined. It sets the foundation for building software that truly solves user problems.

This phase involves understanding what the users need the system to do, why those features are important, and identifying any technical or business limitations.
ðŸ’¡ Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

    âœ… Defines project scope: Helps avoid misunderstandings, scope creep, and ensures everyone is aligned.

    âœ… Saves time and cost: Catching unclear or conflicting requirements early prevents costly changes later in development.

    âœ… Improves quality: A well-defined set of requirements leads to software that is more reliable, maintainable, and user-friendly.

    âœ… Guides design and development: It serves as a blueprint for designers, developers, and testers to follow.

In essence, Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between what the client wants and what the development team builds, making it one of the most important activities in delivering successful software solutions.
